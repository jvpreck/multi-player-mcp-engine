# Oracles and Generators
## Realistic psychological horror · Fear Itself · Solo or party

> **GM-FACING FILE.** These tables answer unknowns, generate material and seed adventures. Behavior is governed by file 01 (`AI_GM_01_Agent_Protocol.md`); rules by file 02 (`AI_GM_02_Fear_Itself_Rules.md`); data shapes by file 05 (`AI_GM_05_State_and_Messages.md`). Facts in the adventure (file 04 or the stored generated adventure) always win over a table result.
>
> **Spoiler warning for players:** §8 lists possible rational causes of strange events. Do not read it if you want to be surprised.
>
> **Dice:** in this game every roll comes from the server's dice stream (file 05 §3.2), used in order and logged. Never invent a number. d20 tables have 20 rows. d10 tables: treat 0 as 10. d6 tables have 6 rows. Everything here is mundane and era-neutral. Adapt names, objects and technology to the declared era (rules §7). There are no monsters, ghosts or curses, only beliefs, suggestions, hazards, illnesses, lies and people.

## 1. When to use an oracle (and when not)

**Use it for:** a yes or no about the world that nothing defines; a new NPC; a random event when play stalls; an item or document; an atmosphere; a scene complication; a hazard; a hook for a new adventure.

**Do not use it for:**
- Core Clues (they are never random).
- A player character's own actions or feelings.
- Anything a General test already covers: use the d6 test (rules §4.2).
- Anything the adventure file or the players have already defined.
- A way to contradict the rational truth.

Oracle results inspire, they do not restrict. Fail forward: even a "No" brings a cost or a way around. The AI Master rolls and interprets, using the dice stream, and logs every roll. Record what an oracle establishes as a world fact (file 05 §2.8) so later ticks stay consistent.

---

## 2. The Yes or No Oracle (d20)

Ask a yes or no question. Choose likelihood. Two d20 means two consecutive values from the d20 stream:
- **Neutral:** roll 1d20.
- **Likely** (advantage, the right tool, the situation favors the investigators): roll 2d20 and keep the **higher**.
- **Unlikely** (pressed for time, outnumbered, unprepared, in danger): roll 2d20 and keep the **lower**.

| d20 | Result | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | No, and | A disaster: a negative consequence too |
| 2 to 6 | No | A simple failure |
| 7 to 10 | No, but | A failure with a small opening |
| 11 to 14 | Yes, but | A success with a minor complication or cost |
| 15 to 19 | Yes | Clean success |
| 20 | Yes, and | An exceptional success with a bonus |

**Drift skew (optional).** If an investigator is at Drift 3 or higher and asks about something they *perceive* (not a physical fact), a natural 1 or 20 means the perception is a Slip: the answer is what they see, but it is not so.

## 3. Adventure seeds

Roll or choose. Combine with the Mundane Cause generator (§8) and the antagonist generator (§9).

| 2 | The leader is not who they appear to be |
| 3 | The "cure" is the cause |
| 4 | The authority that should help is complicit |
| 5 | The victim does not want to be saved |
| 6 | The hazard is older than the current antagonist |
| 7 | The most reliable witness is the most affected |
| 8 | An ally has been quietly gathering evidence the whole time |
| 9 | The cause is well meaning and still lethal |
| 10 | The investigators have already been exposed for longer than they thought |

## 4. Scene Test and Events

### 4.1 Tension and the Scene Test
Keep a **Tension** score from 1 to 6, starting at 2, in the game's GM-only state. Once per tick for each thread (a group of investigators in one place), at the start of the thread's first Block, roll a d6. If the result is equal to or lower than Tension, the scene is **altered**. Roll a d6:
- **1 to 2, Complication:** roll on the Complication table (§10).
- **3 to 4, Interruption:** roll an Event Meaning (§4.2) and add it to the scene.
- **5 to 6, Escalation:** tick the clock, raise Heat or an NPC's belief state by one.

Raise Tension by 1 when the investigators make noise, fail forward or waste a Block. Lower it by 1 after a quiet scene or a successful Haven. Tension never goes below 1 or above 6.

### 4.2 Event Meaning (d20 + d20)
Roll one from each column and interpret in context.

| d20 | Action | Subject |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Withhold | A document |
| 2 | Confess | A witness |
| 3 | Lie | A locked room |
| 4 | Warn | A routine |

## 12. Slips and fear seeds

### 12.1 Fear seeds (d20)

|---|---|
| 1 | Being watched |
| 2 | Not being believed |
| 3 | Being trapped |

### 12.2 Slip tables (d10)
Use these when the module calls for a Slip (rules §5.1). Choose the table by Drift level. Replace {Anchor} with a person or place the investigator relies on, and {Belief} with the shared belief or figure of the adventure. Every Slip needs a **tell**. Never label it a hallucination in narration.

**Slip I (Drift 1 to 2)**

| d10 | Slip |
|---|---|
| 1 | The floor looks wet though it is dry |
| 2 | Movement at the edge of vision, gone when looked at |

| 2 | {Anchor} on the telephone, saying something they would not say |
| 3 | Faces slow, smiles too long |
| 4 | A repeating pattern in the wall forming a figure |
| 5 | A hymn too low to place |
| 6 | The floor warm underfoot |
| 7 | A scene already lived, but wrong |
| 8 | A clock that jumps a quarter hour |
| 9 | Everyone speaks at once, in unison |
| 10 | A figure standing in a doorway who is not there |

**Slip III (Drift 5)**

| d10 | Slip |
|---|---|
| 1 | The walls breathe slowly |
| 2 | Kind voices explain everything |
| 3 | The {Belief} in every shadow, gentle |

| 7 | The notebook entries seem written by someone else |
| 8 | A door that opens on a bright, quiet place |
| 9 | The chant in the investigator's own voice |
| 10 | The landscape glows, welcoming |

---

## 13. Unwanted attention, rumors, opportunities

**Unwanted attention (d10, human only)**

| d10 | Attention |

| 6 | The doctor has not slept for weeks |

| 8 | A priest refused to visit |
| 9 | Someone is selling something to the staff |
| 10 | The place will close soon |

## 14. Quick reminders

- The oracle gives ideas, not Core Clues.
- A Slip never carries a Core Clue and never creates a lethal outcome without a warning cue and a chance to question it.
- Keep distortion a minority of the text. Mundane details make the wrong ones hurt.
- Every strange thing has a rational cause the GM knows.
- If a result clashes with the adventure file, the adventure file wins.
- Every roll comes from the server dice stream and is logged. Record what an oracle establishes.

---

## 15. Emergent adventure kit

Use this for `generated_full` and `generated_emergent` games (file 01 §16). Everything here is private to the AI Master. All dice come from the stream and are logged.

### 15.1 The seed (stored as the GM-only adventure record)

Roll or choose, then make the parts coherent.

1. Setting archetype and why the investigators cannot just leave (§5).
2. The Mundane Cause: source, delivery, concealment and human factor (§8).
3. Hook, stake, time pressure and, optionally, a twist (§3).
4. The antagonist: motivation, method and weakness (§9).
5. Four anchor NPCs: the antagonist, a helper, a witness and an authority (§6).
6. The first place (§5) and the opening handout (§7).
7. The clock in ticks (§15.5).
8. If a hazard fits: its zones and cues (§5, §8).

Write each as one or two plain sentences. State the rational truth first.

### 15.2 Creating things as they are reached

- **A place:** Location concept (§5), Environmental feature (§5), one sensory detail (§5), the zone if a hazard exists, and one detail that hints at its past.
- **An NPC:** Role, Goal, Secret, Visible trait, Manner, Disposition and Belief state (§6), plus a stat tier (§15.4).
- **A document or item:** Item type, Condition, Document type and What it shows (§7).
- **A rumor, an unwanted attention, an event:** §13 and §10.

Save each one immediately (file 01 §10).

### 15.3 Clue routes

For each essential conclusion create at least three routes (the three-clue rule). Choose route types from the table, tie each to an ability that some investigator actually has, and add a Simple Search route. Never route a Core Clue through a Slip.

**Route type (d10)**

| d10 | Route |
|---|---|
| 1 | A document or a record |
| 2 | A witness who saw it |
| 3 | A physical trace: an object, a stain, damage |
| 4 | An expert's opinion |
| 5 | An insider who wants out |
| 6 | A change in someone's routine |
| 7 | A person who left and can be found |
| 8 | A hazard cue in the place |
| 9 | A rumor that can be checked |
| 10 | An ally's own research |

### 15.4 NPC quick stats

**Tier (d6)**: 1 Frail, 2 to 3 Ordinary, 4 to 5 Trained, 6 Dangerous (file 02 §9). Adjust by role: orderlies, guards and constables are Trained at least.

### 15.5 Clock and checkpoints

Set the deadline as a number of ticks. A five-day adventure is five ticks at a day span and twenty at a Block span. Checkpoints, as a share of the deadline:

| Share | What must have happened |
|---|---|
| 25% | The first Core Clue is delivered and the hook has paid off |
| 50% | A twist or a reversal; Heat is 2 to 3 |
| 75% | The antagonist reacts directly (Heat 4 or more); allies are pressured |
| 90% | The finale is designed and at least three fair warnings have begun |
| 100% | The finale resolves in crisis ticks |

### 15.6 Consistency

- The rational truth, once stored, never changes.
- Established facts beat oracle results. Do not use an oracle to answer a question that stored facts already answer.
- Foreshadowing is a promise. Pay off what you plant.
